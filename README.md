## Portfolio Tracker



The Folio Tracker enables the user to track the contents and value of multiple stock portfolios. A Folio Tracker can be used to manage and maintain multiple stock portfolios where a portfolio is a collection of stock holdings. A portfolio could also contain meta-data about a person's transaction history, statistics, etc. The Folio Tracker discovers current stock values by querying a stock quote server to [http://www.tickertech.com/](http://www.tickertech.com/). The tracker is able to:

  manage multiple portfolios;
  create and delete portfolios;
  see the positions (stock name, number of shares held, price per share, and value of the holding) in a portfolio;
  add and remove stocks to the portfolio;
  increase and decrease the number of shares of a stock;
  refresh the stock prices;
  see the total value of a portfolio;
  saving portfolio information to disk.
